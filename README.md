Event Logger
By: Andrew
=============
An app used for keeping track of events

Description
----------------
A project used for recording notable events. It uses a reusable form to let the user create as many events as they want. They can create an event, view all the information of the event, edit the event, and delete the event. For the background and button designs I went with a space theme, so starry sky and green

Project requirements
--------------------
- [x] Add full CRUD functionality for types of events to be logged. For instance, in a bird-watching application, a user might add "Spotted Sandpiper" to indicate a viewing of that kind of bird.
- [x] Allow users to increment the event by one when there is a viewing, a play of the game, or so on. Users should also be able to decrement an event (for instance, if they made a mistake).

Additional exploration
----------------------
- [x] Add a background. Also make the background scale with the size of the display.
- [ ] Add a multiple pages function into the site for organization purposes.
